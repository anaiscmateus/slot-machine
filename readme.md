## How It's Made

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Here's a brief overview of how it was developed:

- HTML: The structure and layout of the game.
- CSS: Styling and animations, including dynamically changing the cat images.
- JavaScript: Game logic, random cat selection, betting mechanism, and win-checking.

I learned that the logic used for randomly selecting slots in this game is similar to other game-related logic. Prior experience with a Rock, Paper, Scissors project helped in understanding and implementing this logic efficiently. One of the significant challenges I faced was dynamically changing the cat images based on the selected cats. This was achieved by using class names in CSS to set the background images of three small div elements.

## Optimizations (Planned)

While the project is fully functional, there are some optimizations in the pipeline to enhance the user experience:

- Adding a reset button when the player runs out of money.
- Refactoring the `pickSlots()` function to remove redundancy and improve code efficiency.

Stay tuned for updates!

## Lessons Learned

During the development of this project, I gained valuable insights:

- Reusing code logic is a powerful approach to efficiently solve similar problems in different projects.
- Utilizing CSS classes for dynamic content manipulation with JavaScript can make web pages more interactive and engaging.
